# Task Manager CLI — Guidelines

A concise set of guidelines, checklist, and best practices for the Task Manager CLI project. Use this to keep each iteration focused on learning goals, maintain good habits, and produce a reproducible, testable Java project.

## Purpose & learning goals
This project teaches and reinforces:
- Java basics (classes, OOP, exceptions)
- Collections, generics, and serialization (JSON)
- File I/O and persistence
- Unit testing (JUnit 5) and test-first thinking
- Build tooling (Maven or Gradle) and simple CI
- CLI design and user input validation

List explicit learning goals at the top of your project README so each commit maps back to something you want to practice.

---

## Core principles (apply to every project)
- Start small and iterate: implement an MVP first, then add features.
- Make learning goals explicit and visible in README.
- Use consistent folder structure and naming.
- Keep commits small and focused with clear messages.
- Write tests for core logic first (or at least quickly after).
- Add a simple CI pipeline that runs build & tests.
- Document design tradeoffs and key decisions in `design.md` or `NOTES.md`.

## Project checklist (copy to project README)
- [ ] Project purpose and learning goals
- [ ] Build tool: `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle)
- [ ] Source layout: `src/main/java`, `src/test/java`
- [ ] Unit tests for core logic (aim for important behavior coverage)
- [ ] README with quick start, build, run, test commands
- [ ] .gitignore and LICENSE
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow to build and test
- [ ] TODO or issues tracking next steps
- [ ] `NOTES.md` or `design.md` that records decisions & what you learned
